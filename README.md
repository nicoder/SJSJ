# Simplified JavaScript Jargon

*Simplified JavaScript Jargon* (short *SJSJ*) is a community-driven attempt at explaining the loads of buzzwords making the current JavaScript ecosystem in a few simple words. The idea is not to replace individual documentations, but to act as some kind of glossary that can be easily referenced.
